        <p>Every winter, college basketball teams across the nation compete in games that spark school spirit, draw viewers from across the world in, and amaze fans with electric highlights. All three of those aspects lead to large amounts of revenue for the schools. According to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-who-is-winning-in-the-high-revenue-world-of-college-sports#:~:text=Football%20is%20the%20highest%20grossing,make%20money%20from%20college%20sports."> PBS</a>, college basketball brings in the second-most revenue for NCAA athletics. In the state of New York, 22 schools trotted out men’s and women’s basketball teams in 2021, which generated nearly $135 million in revenue (Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA)).</p>

        <p class="Army">(Note: Army West Point does not report athletic revenues and expenses, according to the <a href="https://usmadata.com/2022/01/24/army-athletics-is-big-business/"> Federal Audit Clearinghouse Image Mangement System </a>)</p>

        <p>With high revenue comes high operations costs to keep improving the quality of the sport. A big chunk of those costs are spent on the players. In the state of New York, according to EADA, approximately 6.7% of Division I program operations costs are spent on players.</p>

        <p>Dave Meluni, a professor at Syracuse University’s Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, said team travel, student aid, player equipment and clothes, and meals are the four main factors included in operation costs for players. While some programs spend far more money on players than others, Meluni added that it doesn’t reflect on how well a school treats them.</p>

        <p>“[Some schools] just don’t have the money to spend,” Meluni said. “They’re budgets prevent them from overspending.”</p>

        <p class="caption">Syracuse, St. John's spend the most money on its basketball players</p>

        <p>At the top of the list of highest spenders sits Syracuse and St. Johns. From 2010-2021, the schools reached 17 and 5 men's and women's NCAA tournaments respectively. Syracuse has also appeared in three final fours during the span. Both the Orange and Big Red play in Power 6 conferences (a consensus term that groups the most competitive basketball conferences together) - St. Johns in the Big East, and Syracuse in the Big East (2010-2013) and ACC (2014-present). Despite the reputation for winning, Meluni said winning doesn’t play too much of a factor in operation costs; instead, teams must win in recruiting.</p>

        <p>“You’re not necessarily going to win if you spend more, but you can win in recruiting,” Meluni said.</p>

        <p>According to Meluni, teams who win in recruiting are typically the ones that spend large amounts of money on operation costs. Meluni added that recruits are drawn to stuff such as access to equipment and transportation, with transportation being a key expense to recruiting players.</p>

        <p>“Syracuse and St. John’s fly charter,” Meluni said. “That’s why those two figures are significantly higher than others.”</p>

        <p>While spending doesn’t equal winning on the court, Meluni said that winning on the court can lead to more spending to keep a strong team intact. A prime example of this is Siena. From 2008 to 2010, Siena men’s basketball made the NCAA tournament, with the school seeded at No. 9 in 2009. In the three years following 2010, Siena’s operational cost on players for the men’s team increased each season.</p>

        <p>Coaching changes can also see a drastic difference in operational costs. In the three seasons after 2010, Seina didn’t return to the NCAA Tournament and thus fired head coach Mitch Buonaguro. When new head coach Jimmy Patsos took the job for the 2013-14 season, operation costs on players more than doubled beginning in 2015. When Pastos resigned in 2018, operation costs plummeted in 2020 and 2021.<p>

        <p>Another cost that separates teams in terms of operation costs, according to Meluni, is student aid. According to <a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/recruiting/how-to-get-recruited/scholarship-facts">NCSA College Recruiting</a>, schools will offer athletic scholarships to its students to cover tuition, fees, room and board, books, and other living expenses. According to Meluni, a basketball scholarship for a men’s or women’s basketball player must be a full scholarship.</p>

        <p class="caption">A basketball scholarship, men's or women's, must cover 100% of student expenses for the university</p>

        <p>Student aid, while offered at most Division I schools, is often harder to get at “high-academic conference” schools. A prime example of this are the two Ivy League schools in New York - Cornell and Columbia - that sit near the bottom of the list of spending. According to Meluni, those schools don’t offer any student aid to their athletes; The NCSA says the only aid athletes receive at Ivy League schools are need based.</p>

        <p>Some institutions will offer more in their scholarships for basketball players depending on their situation, which sometimes has to do with academics. Meluni pointed out Fordham as a great example of this. While the Rams play football in the Patriot League, a high-academic conference, their basketball team plays in the A-10 and receives a lot more attention.</p>

        <p>“Basketball is football at Fordham,” Meluni said. Meluni added that schools that don’t have football typically have leeway to spend more on its basketball players. This is a key reason why schools such Stony Brook and Iona sit near the top of the chart.</p>

        <p>While schools that generate the majority of their revenue from basketball have higher operational costs, schools that also generate lots of football revenue have room to spend more on other sports such as basketball. Meluni said a good example of this is Buffalo, who plays in the FBS, the top football division in the NCAA.</p>

        <p>Meluni says he expects to see major changes in operational costs on players with name, image, and likeness (NIL) now legal at the collegiate level.</p>

        <p>“Schools cannot do anything financially with NIL, so there’s not much they can do [from an operational standpoint recruiting players],” Meluni said. “This whole thing could be changing considerably.”</p>
